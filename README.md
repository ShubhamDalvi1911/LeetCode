| Problem | Path | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Two Sum (LeetCode #1) | `NumberProblems/twosum.py` | **Solved** ✅ | Returns indices of two numbers that add up to the target (example usages included) |
| Add Two Numbers (LeetCode #2) | `NumberProblems/addtwonumbers.py` | **Solved** ✅ | Adds two numbers represented as linked lists; example prints `[7, 0, 8]` |
| Longest Substring (LeetCode #3) | `StringProblems/longestsubstring.py` | **Solved** ✅ | `partition_unique_substrings(s)` partitions s into maximal substrings with unique characters; e.g., `"Satyam"` -> `['Saty', 'am']`, `"dvdf"` -> `['dv', 'vdf']` |

## How to run 🔧

To run the example for Two Sum:

```
python NumberProblems/twosum.py
```

To run the example for Add Two Numbers:

```
python NumberProblems/addtwonumbers.py
```

To run the example for Partition Unique Substrings / Longest Substring:

```
python StringProblems/longestsubstring.py
```

Expected output (example):

```
Unique substrings without duplicate characters are: ['pw', 'wke', 'kew']
Length of longest substring without duplicate characters is: 3
```
