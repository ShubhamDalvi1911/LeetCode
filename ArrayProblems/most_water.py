'''11. Container With Most Water
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1'''
def maxArea(height):
    left = 0
    right = len(height)-1
    Most_Water = 0
    while left < right:
        width = right - left
        h = min(height[left],height[right])
        area = width * h
        Most_Water = max(Most_Water, area)

        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left = left + 1
        else:
            right = right - 1
    return Most_Water
